Interim Report
	The project we were assigned was the Temperature and 
Humidity Sensor assignment. The assignment will be created and 
ran on the Raspberry Pi. In this project, we have to read in the
temperature and humidity of the room, put it on a local database
and transfer it over to a user friendly web server that is 
accessible to only us and any authorized personnel. So far, we 
have written and tested the code for the humidity and temperature 
sensor and created the code so that we could transfer it to the 
local database. We now need to test and make possible changes to
our database code and then create a web server and make it only
accessible to certain people. So far, all of us have worked on 
creating and testing the code we are using for the humidity and 
temperature sensor and John has been setting up the wiring for
the sensor since he is more knowledgeable about how and where to
connect everything. Once we create our local database, we will 
start making the web server so that it is functional and user 
friendly. After that, we will test it as a whole and be finished 
with the project
